      <p>Hello, I am Essence Jones and I pay rent for this tiny corner of the world wide web. I am a Visual Communication Design student at Herron School of Art + Design and a multi-passionate creative. You can usually find me wandering downtown Indianapolis, looking for the ideal coffee shop where I can introvert.</p>

      <p>I am happiest when my hands are busy with clay, paint, or ink. I am myself when I am hovered over a potters wheel, or covered with paint and a brush in hand. I enjoy working with multiple mediums because it allows for more freedom, experimenting, and possibilities. An abstract painting or a sculpture, I pull inspiration from nature, experiences, people in my life, and the world we live.</p>

      <p>I am over the moon excited to share this shop with you all and I hope you enjoy my work as much as I enjoy creating. I appreciate and welcome feedback, comments or just a simple hello.</p>
      
      <p>Essence Jones</p>
